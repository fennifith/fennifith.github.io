Earlier this week, [Corbin Crutchley](https://crutchcorn.dev/) built a social image generator for the [Unicorn Utterances](https://playfulprogramming.com/) blog using React and puppeteer. This was built from a mockup that was expertly designed by [Kevin Aguilar](https://twitter.com/kevttob) - featuring an intuitive layout, clear accented title text, and a background image displaying arbitrary PHP code on a laptop screen.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As of today, every single blog post on <a href="https://twitter.com/UnicornUttrncs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UnicornUttrncs</a> has a unique social media preview with the title of the blog post<br><br>Huge thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/kevttob?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@kevttob</a> for designing the preview image!<a href="https://t.co/uh0Her4Y1X">https://t.co/uh0Her4Y1X</a></p>&mdash; Corbin Crutchley ðŸ¥‘ (@crutchcorn) <a href="https://twitter.com/crutchcorn/status/1527537422833135616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This gave me an interesting idea: what if, instead of displaying arbitrary code, it used the actual code snippets featured in the blog posts? Instead of embedding an image, I could use overlapping HTML elements with some elaborate CSS styling to recreate its appearance with any text content.

## Background

* [Unicorn Utterances](https://playfulprogramming.com) is a community blog site featuring awesome technical and educational content from a variety of incredibly skilled developers and engineers.

* The "social/preview image" being described here is what shows up when the link to a blog post is displayed in a post or message on social media. While some social platforms use varying implementations, most of this information is provided through the [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me).

## Implementation

### 3D Rotation

[The original image](https://unsplash.com/photos/OqtafYT5kTw) (Unsplash) was angled at a specific position that had the camera facing slightly downwards from the top left side of the screen. This is fairly simple to recreate using the [`rotate3d(x, y, z, a)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/rotate3d) CSS function. While it required a bit of fine-tuning later on, this allowed for a close approximation of its general appearance.

### Depth of Field

The camera also used a very shallow depth of field to focus on a small part of the screen. In the image, this looks more like a post-processing effect applied by an image editor than the actual camera lens. However, there is no easy way to recreate depth of field using CSS - even with the 3d transform functions. I had to find a different way of accomplishing this.

While CSS doesn't provide any visual "focus" properties, there is a [`blur(radius)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/blur) filter function which applies a Gaussian blur to any element on the screen. The result looks a lot like the "out of focus" area of the original image.

To create the "in focus" area, I then created a duplicate copy of the element (since this was built in React, this is a lot simpler than it sounds) with a higher [`z-index`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) value. Using the [`mask-image`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-image) property, I applied a radial gradient mask to this element, creating a focused center that gradually fades into the blurred background element.

```css
.codeScreen {
	transform: rotate3d(0.5, 1, 0, 45deg);
	mask-image: radial-gradient(circle 500px at 25% 50%, rgba(0,0,0,1), rgba(0,0,0,0));
	z-index: -2;
}

.codeScreen.blur {
	mask-image: none;
	filter: blur(5px);
	z-index: -1;
}
```

![An angled screen of code in which a central focused area gradually becomes blurred towards the edges of the image.](/images/blogs/uu-previews/03-blur.png)

### Grainy Overlay

While this is much closer to the original, I still wasn't done yet. I wanted the result to be almost indistinguishable from the original image. This styling was too perfect and uniform; its appearance was too consistent to be mistaken for anything but a rendered HTML surface.

So what gave the original version its imperfect, authentic appearance? There's a tiny lens flare, slight pixelation of the text... and an almost unnoticeable hint of dust, grain, and possible compression artifacts on the screen.

So I looked up how to implement [grainy gradients in CSS](https://css-tricks.com/grainy-gradients/).

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="600" height="600">
	<filter id="noiseFilter">
		<feTurbulence
			type="fractalNoise"
			baseFrequency="0.65"
			numOctaves="3"
			stitchTiles="stitch"/>
	</filter>
	<rect width="100%" height="100%" filter="url(#noiseFilter)"/>
</svg>
```
Applying this to a foreground element with low opacity yielded almost exactly the effect I was looking for. Hardly noticeable, but definitely less recognizable as an HTML-rendered surface.

### Perspective

There was only one thing left to do, which Corbin actually discovered in a code review: improving the 3d transformation. The current transformation was "isometric," the default behavior of the `rotate3d()` function; it lacked any [perspective projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection).

I had previously attempted to apply this using the [`perspective`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/perspective) property, but failed to notice any effect of doing so - perhaps because I was applying it to the wrong element. This property needs to be applied to *the parent element* of wherever the transformation is taking place.

```html
<div style="perspective: 1000px;">
	<div class="codeScreen">...</div>
	<div class="codeScreen blur">...</div>
</div>
```
