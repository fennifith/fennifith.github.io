# Now

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It's a way to share everything currently happening in my life. I last updated it on 2024-08-10.

## What am I doing now?

- [making strange noises on the internet](https://fennifith.bandcamp.com/)
- building weird software for fun; and [streaming it on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/fennifith)
- [playing Minecraft](https://minecraft.horrific.dev/) with a group of friends and pondering [confusing redstone mechanics](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Quasi-connectivity)
- learning [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org) and working on [an overcomplicated snake game](https://gitlab.com/fennifith/snake)

## Groups I'm involved with

[Unicorn Utterances](https://unicorn-utterances.com/) is a collaborative blog site that provides helpful resources for a variety of computer science-related topics.

[The Frame Drops](https://theframedrops.com) occasionally organizes small fundraisers to support a charity through various programming & gaming events.
