          <p><span class="text__notice">I originally wrote this post as a class assignment, and while I believe the information here is accurate, I have some qualms about the ideas it presents - mainly that it focuses largely on Apple, while in actuality, Right to Repair is about a whole lot more. I plan to expand on this in a future post, covering its implications in more detail.</span></p>

<p>The consumer’s “right to repair” is becoming an increasingly relevant issue with technical products
and devices in modern society. Large corporations like Apple have formed an exclusionary environment
for consumers in which people are prevented from repairing their own devices, and are instead
belittled for their so-called misuse of a product. As a result of this, customers and third-party
repair stores are made to feel at the mercy of a large and monopolous company that is more able to
perform repairs. This argument does have opposition: Apple has strongly affirmed that their
restrictions on consumer and third-party repairs are solely for the safety of the user and to prevent
illegitimate clones of the devices from appearing in the market, and supporters have argued that they
hold no liability for ensuring that devices are repaired. However, these points do not justify the
misleading behavior that Apple has used and the lies that their support staff have told to customers.
This paper aims to provide a clear view of both sides of this debate, and assert the ways in which
the “right to repair” can ensure the freedom of the consumer and benefit the communities surrounding
these products.</p>

<h2 id="the-apple-store">The Apple Store</h2>

<p><img src="/images/papers/apple-store-la.jpg" alt="A Los Angeles Apple Store, bleak and metallic, with an ominous illuminated Apple logo in the center." />
<em>Image: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_Store_LA.jpg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_Store_LA.jpg</a></em></p>

<p>To the unknowing customer, Apple’s stores have a very shiny appeal. Not only their physical
appearance, but the entire brand comes with a sense of cleanliness and perfect simplicity. Their
logo embodies this aspect of their design, often printed on a blank white box that their products
are shipped in, along with the product name as the only other information provided on the front panel.
The devices themselves are also designed in this manner. Most are formed from a single block of
aluminium, presenting a clean and unblemished surface to the user, and hiding all of the inner
workings of the device. Even using Apple’s software, certain information is hidden from you. On the
iPhone, there is no element of the “file system” made visible to the user; the iOS operating system
as a whole is opaque as to where any information is stored. Users are given a basic file manager (the
“Files” app, in iOS 11), but this does not show what information is really there – it only displays
information synced to the user’s iCloud account, not what is physically stored on the device <a href="#Sorrel">(1)</a>.
When backing up the data on an iPhone, there is no indication of where the backup is located or how
to move or transfer it, it just exists. If the iPhone is dropped in a puddle and will not turn on,
then, according to Apple, all of that data is gone. When this happens, the customer can only take
their phone to Apple’s nearest “Genius Bar”, where it is obviously repaired by the all-knowing Geniuses.
The customer is belittled for their silly mistake of breaking the phone – obviously unrelated to any
possible design flaw that it might have – and is then told to buy a new one. They are told that a small
amount of water damage cannot be repaired, and that all of their data that is not backed up to the
iCloud is now gone.</p>

<p>This is the face that Apple shows their customers, and many people have expressed concern that it is
false. As the influential YouTuber Louis Rossman recurrently says, the people working at
the “Genius Bar” are not really geniuses; they are just told to speak according to Apple’s “Genius
Training Student Workbook”. According to Jay Elliot, who has authored two books about Apple, “you’ve
got to be totally wedded to the culture. You’ve got to love the product and what it is. They love the
product” <a href="#Khan">(2)</a>. A former Apple Store employee has said that they are treated as if they are a
part of a cult, forced to involve themselves in product launches, integrating their souls with Apple,
and lying to customers about how their devices work. “We usually have to tell them that if they unlock
their iPhone, it won’t work. That it’s going to be like a $700 paperweight, and that the antenna will
fry itself on T-Mobile. Of course, that’s not true, but that’s what we tell them” <a href="#Anonymous">(3)</a>.
This elitist view is propogated by users that believe in Apple’s vision, thinking that the “Geniuses”
at Apple know exactly what they are doing, that users are always in the wrong, and that the products
they sell are the perfect image of technological innovation.</p>

<h3 id="louis-rossman-and-the-counterfeit-batteries">Louis Rossman and the Counterfeit Batteries</h3>

<p>One person who has argued extensively against Apple’s exclusionary behavior is Louis Rossmann, an
influential YouTuber and the owner of a small store in New York City that specializes in MacBook repair.
As an independent repair shop that is not a part of of Apple’s “Authorized Service Provider” program,
Rossmann is classified by Apple as “unauthorized” to repair their products and has few viable methods of
obtaining the components necessary to fix them, short of buying broken devices and salvaging them for
working parts. However, this does not always work for parts such as batteries, which can deteriorate
and become less effective with age. Last year, Rossmann ordered a shipment of laptop batteries from
China for a computer that Apple no longer services. When it reached the United States, however, the
package was seized by the Customs and Border Protection (CPB) as an illegal and counterfeit product.
Apple claims that the computer which they no longer service is a “vintage” product, which makes
illegitimate parts such as the ones that Rossmann ordered illegal under US law – specifically, the CPB
took issue with Apple’s logo being used on the batteries, and not the batteries themselves. As Rossmann
says, “There has to be a line where putting your logo somewhere no longer means ‘this can be confiscated
at the border’”. Louis Rossmann is not the only person experiencing these problems, either. Jessa Jones,
another independent repair professional, had a shipment of iPhone screens seized in the same year.
According to Rossman, “the difference between counterfeiting and refurbishing is going to be the next
big battle” between the independent repair profession and Apple <a href="#Gault">(4)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="apple-authorized-service-providers-and-the-broken-imac-pro">Apple Authorized Service Providers and the Broken iMac Pro</h3>

<p>For repair stores to qualify as one of Apple’s Authorized Service Providers (AASPs), they must meet a
plethora of requirements for how they deal with customers. One of these requirements is that they must
buy the parts for a repair directly from Apple, leaving them with a questionable profit margin and
unable to compete with other stores in regards to how much their repairs cost. In addition, when they
order a part from Apple, they are held to strict standards about how they use it – it must go into an
Apple device and cannot be sold separately to a customer or they might lose their certification. Not
only does the business need to provide Apple with complete and accurate information of their sales and
financial records, but all of their technicians need to be certified as well, through Apple’s own
training program and classes – which, of course, are not free <a href="#Apple">(5)</a>. There is more than just one
certification, though – Apple has an individual certification for each of their devices, and AASPs
cannot sell a repair for a device unless they have a technician that is certified (through Apple’s
program) to repair it. The impact that all of these requirements have on the customer was brought to
fruition when Linus Sebastian, of the YouTube channel “Linus Tech Tips”, detailed their experience
trying to fix a broken iMac Pro. Because they took the device apart and broke it themselves, they were
willing to pay to have it repaired, but the Apple Store refused to do so. When contacting a local AASP,
Sebastian found out that they were able to order the parts, but could not approve the sale because they
did not have the Apple Pro certification – which, according to several AASP employees, did not actually
exist yet <a href="#Rossignol">(6)</a>. Because Apple is so restrictive about who can repair their devices, they
should be held to a standard that they are able to fix the products that they sell – similar to buying a
car, it should be possible to repair even if it is broken immediately after its release. The problem is
that human mistakes are frequent, and consumers have no way to get their $5000 metallic obelisk to
function again if they end up breaking it, short of buying a new one. Apple’s unwillingness to support
their own devices shows an obvious lack of care for their end users, and is one of the main reasons
that “right to repair” is such an important issue today.</p>

<h3 id="future-worries-the-t2-chip-causes-yet-more-problems">Future Worries: The T2 Chip Causes Yet More Problems</h3>

<p>In a blog post by iFixit, a company that offers tools and repair guides with a clear focus on enabling
people to understand and repair their electronic devices by themselves, Adam O’Camb details a difference
in new versions of Apple’s products which ensure that this issue will only get worse. According to O’Camb,
Apple’s new T2 chip will require a specific configuration suite in order to complete repairs – a software
that is only available to authorized and Apple-certified “professionals”. After replacing a part, the
configuration suite connects to Apple’s server to perform performance and compatibility checks for new
parts. As described by Apple, “Without this software, an internet connection, and approval from Apple’s
servers, the repair is considered incomplete and the computer is rendered inoperable” <a href="#O-Camb">(7)</a>.
This functionality effectively prevents any significant repairs by consumers to their own devices, let
alone giving “unauthorized” repair centers great reason to worry about their future profit.</p>

<h2 id="nebraska-legislation-bill-67">Nebraska Legislation Bill 67</h2>

<p>The opposing arguments to these problems all seem to state in some form that Apple’s restrictions aiming
to prevent people from repairing their own devices do so righteously – that people are protected from
messing around for their own and others safety. When Apple lobbied against a “right to repair” proposal
in Nebraska in 2017, Apple representative Steve Kester warned that the state would become “a Mecca for
bad actors” if the bill were passed. According to them, the legislation could provide hackers and other
unsavory characters “hardware-level access to Apple products”. However, it is important to recognize
the bias that Apple has to make these claims; supporters of the bill have asserted that many of the
companies opposing it “are only interested in holding sway over the lucrative repair industry”, and
that opening up the market would instead “present consumers with more choices” <a href="#Campbell">(8)</a>. The
tech industry’s stance on this is clear, though, as shown by Apple and other companies’ strong arguments
against this legislation. Right to Repair has a great amount of relevance for users living in rural areas,
as companies often position their repair centers in major cities and areas with a large population.
As long as companies like Apple restrict the places that people are allowed to go to repairs, this issue
will continue. Currently, 17 states - including Nebraska - have introduced legislation that would force
Apple to provide repair manuals and spare parts to third parties. It is worth noticing that if even one
of these states passes the bill, its impact would span far outside that, as it is likely that large companies
will not want to operate differently in a specific state. Quoting the NY State Assembly Majority Leader
Joe Morelle, “[…] that could actually pass Right to Repair for the world, because manufactures aren’t
going to provide products differently to people in one jurisdiction. They want to simplify their
operations” <a href="#Shprintsen">(9)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The variety of points and arguments that have been provided in this paper show that “Right to Repair”
is an issue of drastic importance today. As the owner of a maintainable product that is built from the
same parts used in thousands of other devices, consumers should not be prevented from performing their
own repairs and taking their devices apart. There are many situations where someone may want to do this,
and it is often the case that users are unable to have their devices serviced by someone that is
authorized to do so. While the stance of this article is clear, it should be noted that “Right to Repair”
extends far beyond the situations that this paper has discussed. The legislation being proposed affects
a vast area of products including any electronics with embedded software - home appliances, medical
devices, and heavy machinery are some notable examples. The discourse surrounding this movement could
have vast effects on how customers are able to interact with companies worldwide.</p>
