        <div class="e-content entry markdown">
          
          <p><span class="text__attention">The Fediverse</span> is best explained as an
interconnected web of services that communicate with each other with a shared
protocol. Imagine that you had an account on one social website from which you
could send, receive, and reply to posts from people that use different websites
with a different interface and behavior. This is a vague explanation of how
federation works that skips over a lot of the technical details, but think of
replying to a blog post from your Instagram account, or seeing your friends’
Facebook posts in your Twitter feed.</p>

<p>This interoperability of common actions such as “likes”, “replies”, and
“follows” is what unifies the majority of federated social networks; nobody
loses access to friends or connections because they use a different website. The
communication protocols used by these servers implement
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard">open standards</a>, which means that
they can be freely adopted, implemented, and extended by everyone. In effect,
anyone can create and own a fediverse server with the ability to interact with
virtually any other server using this protocol.</p>

<h2 id="technicalities">Technicalities</h2>

<p>Because of the “open” nature of the fediverse, nearly all networks are developed
by a community of people independent from any corporation or official
institution. Most software related to the fediverse is open source, so anyone
can participate in their growth and development. What is important to note,
though, is that the fediverse isn’t one singular thing. It consists of a huge
amount of different projects, groups, discussions, and ideas.</p>

<h3 id="servers-networks-protocols">Servers, Networks, Protocols</h3>

<p>Fediverse servers, or “instances”, are the smallest part of the fediverse, and
what you’ll see the most of. Because the majority of the fediverse is open
source, anyone can create their own server by just choosing a domain and paying
for hosting. Some people make their servers publicly available for anyone to
use, others only allow access for a small group, and some individuals have one
just for themselves. A list of some of the public servers you can join can be
found at <a href="https://the-federation.info/">the-federation.info</a>; some notable ones
being <a href="https://mastodon.technology/">mastodon.technology</a>,
<a href="https://digipres.club/">digipres.club</a>, <a href="https://cybre.space/">cybre.space</a>,
<a href="https://witches.live/">witches.live</a>, and <a href="https://toot.cat/">toot.cat</a>.</p>

<p>Most of these federated servers can be categorized by the software that they
use. While they all accomplish the same goal of <em>being a social network</em>, there
are many different interfaces or implementations of the federated protocols that
various people have written. Some of the more popular examples include
<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a>,
<a href="https://friendi.ca/">Friendica</a>, <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a>,
<a href="https://write.as/">write.as</a>, and <a href="https://socialhome.network/">Socialhome</a>.</p>

<p>Protocols are the communication standards that these federated servers can use
to communicate with each other. The dominant protocol is currently
<a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>, but
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/">OStatus</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/friendica/friendica/wiki/Protocol">DFRN</a> do exist as well.
To provide features that aren’t a part of the protocol, certain networks can
deviate from the protocol(s) they support to provide endpoints and functionality
that other software won’t know how to use. For example, one fictional project
called “Hands” could provide a “poke” button to send useless notifications to
people. As far as I know, the ActivityPub protocol doesn’t specify a “poke”
button, so users would only be able to poke people on the “Hands” network
(someone on a Mastodon server would be out of reach). This is somewhat rare,
though, as even in cases where some functionality might not translate to other
software as effectively, most developers do their best to maintain compatibility
with the rest of the fediverse.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-vs-decentralized">Distributed vs. Decentralized</h2>

<p><img src="/images/blogs/Centralised-decentralised-distributed.png" alt="A diagram illustrating the differences between a decentralized and distributed network." />
<em>Image: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Decentralization_diagram.svg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Decentralization_diagram.svg</a></em></p>

<p>One notable point about the fediverse’s construction is that it does not create
a <em>completely</em> decentralized social media - it’s still subject to some of the
same issues and caveats of some centralized services, but it caters to a lot of
the concerns that someone looking for a decentralized service might have. To
quote <a href="https://twitter.com/mccrmx/status/1188642269131264000">Chris McCormick</a>,
“decentralization is a means to an end, not an end in itself.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>distributed: when separate systems coordinate. placement of authority is a
differentiating factor of their design.</p>

  <p>decentralized: distributed system that can elect to defer or migrate central
authority. mutable actions may be negotiated.</p>

  <p>federated: distributed system that has nomadic and often competitive
authorities. actors negotiate their own activity at any point.</p>

  <p>- <a href="https://mastodon.social/@wilkie">@wilkie@mastodon.social</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the heaviest criticisms of this model is that, instead of trusting a
known mega-company like Facebook or Twitter to facilitate your online identity,
you now rely on a random stranger to keep their server running and appropriately
moderate their instance. This brings me to two points:</p>

<h4 id="1-the-owner-of-your-instance-is-not-supposed-to-be-a-stranger">1. The owner of your instance is not <em>supposed</em> to be a stranger.</h4>

<p>This obviously differs depending on which social groups you are a part of, and
some of the larger public instances definitely stray from this condition, but
(in my opinion) the advantages of federated networks are much more effective
when those networks are kept relatively small. Imagine a private instance for a
specific neighborhood or a hobby organization - or just a random group of
friends.</p>

<p><a href="https://tinysubversions.com/">Darius Kazemi</a> gave a talk back in August titled
<a href="https://vimeo.com/354276253">“Trust is Not Harmful”</a>, in which they describe a
lot of their experiences and motivations for creating
<a href="https://friend.camp/">friend.camp</a>, a small Mastodon instance for a bunch of
their friends to explore the advantages that decentralized social media can
offer. This presents a few different ideas about how this technology can be
used - notably, the software can be customized to fit the needs of its specific
users (for example, <a href="https://dolphin.town/about/more">dolphin.town</a>), and the
owners/users of the instance can more effectively exchange trust with each
other.</p>

<p>I’ll come back to that first idea later on, but the latter brings up an
important distinction: smaller groups are much easier to moderate. In a social
network, it’s far easier to split up the governance and rules of “what you’re
allowed to say on the internet” between various groups, because not all groups
have the same social guidelines of what they deem to be acceptable in their
community. A lot of what you <em>should</em> say depends on who you’re talking to -
it’s not necessarily wrong to discuss your hobby of combining peanut butter and
celery, but you might get a few strange looks if you bring it up obsessively in
your local book readers’ club. If you aim to disrupt reading time with your
vegetable preachings, the threat of being removed from the club will probably
keep you in line. Quoting Darius, “decentralized networks map somewhat cleanly
onto real human networks, and it’s the social relations and the trust built into
them that hold the key to building something valuable.”</p>

<p>Another point that is brought up is that it’s far easier to moderate a smaller
community when you actually know every person in the network and are able to sit
down and talk to them - and this brings benefits for the users of that network
as well. Rather than waiting for an overworked moderation team or trusting an
obscure automated program to review a post, you actually know the specific
person to get in contact with if something goes wrong - and unlike the CEO of
Twitter, they actually have the time to respond to each of their users.</p>

<h4 id="2-even-a-stranger-might-be-more-trustworthy-than-the-social-media-companies-we-know">2. <em>Even a stranger</em> might be more trustworthy than the social media companies we know.</h4>

<p>I mentioned an exemption to the condition of a federated instance owner being a
stranger in the case of many of the large public networks that exist, and a lot
of people question what the difference between a huge instance like
<a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social</a> and any centralized network like
Twitter would be. For this, I have to point to some of the ideals of the
Mastodon community and a lot of their users’ reasons for moving away from these
larger services in the first place.</p>

<p>The first reason is that companies like Twitter have a fundamental need to
profit from their users. A good portion of the fediverse is funded almost
entirely from community donations and the generosity of their creators, so they
don’t <em>need</em> to resort to some of the larger platforms’ methods of large-scale
advertising and data hoarding in order to break even. So even if you have to
trust a stranger on the fediverse, a lot of the users there think it’s better to
trust someone you don’t really know than rely on a company that’s exploiting
your online presence to make a profit. Sam the sandwich man might have a strange
moustache, but at least he isn’t going to capitalize on my human need for social
interaction.</p>

<p>Another reason is its approach to an online presence - particularly, how it
handles privacy and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">“Right to be Forgotten”</a>.
A lot of the fediverse has a fairly strong opposition to the archival or
indexing of their posts/profiles, and many subscribe to the idea that their
content should be something that eventually disappears. This is also reflected
in their approach to implementing a search box: “Lack of full-text search on
general content is intentional, due to negative social dynamics of it in other
networks” - <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/4947733">@Gargron@mastodon.social</a>.
Some of the potential reasons for supporting this viewpoint are made pretty
clear in wilkie’s post about
<a href="https://wilkie.how/posts/social-archival">Social Archival</a>; that, even if some
content might be public, it doesn’t necessarily mean the authors have given
consent for anyone to do whatever they want with it.</p>

<p>Finally, perhaps the most practical reason that the fediverse can be useful is
because of its software. Mastodon and Pixelfed are well known for maintaining
accessibility standards; both have supported image captions for a long time, and
their developers put a great deal of effort into designing an interface that can
be used by everyone. It doesn’t end there, though - tying this back to the first
idea from Darius Kazemi’s talk, I have to emphasize that
<em>nearly all of this software is open source.</em> This means that, if you’re hosting
your own instance for a group or community, <em>you can change how it works.</em> This
is a benefit of open source that I (and many others) have touted for a long
time: the ability to create functionality for a small group or even a single
person that just wouldn’t make sense for anyone else. Do you want to make the
“reply” button lock you out of the interface for 15 minutes so that you can
really think about what you want to say? Remove all of your notifications in
place of a daily email digest to cut down on anxiety? Go ahead! Noone can stop
you. Just remember to use your newfound powers for good.</p>

<h2 id="deplatforming-and-free-speech">Deplatforming and Free Speech</h2>

<p>Because fediverse instances are managed individually, moderation is largely left
to the owner of the server you’re using or interacting with. When you use
someone’s network, the owner is granting you access to share your thoughts
through their server - it isn’t an inherent right, and it can be taken away.
However, this largely depends on the views of the owner, and most will try to
contact users to come to an agreement before enforcing an outright ban.</p>

<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1357/">XKCD: #1357</a></p>

<p>This is a very political topic but, in my experience, arguments for free speech
are generally not really arguing for “free speech”. They’re arguing to restrict
the power of people who own social instances to control the content that their
network shares and promotes. When you join a fediverse instance - or rather, any
social network - you submit yourself to the judgement of its owner for whose
content you can see and which instances you can interact with. It’s okay for
people to share their opinions, but it’s also well within the right of social
instances to refuse to accept them. Disallowing this would mean creating a
social network without a “block” button - it would mean creating a law to
prevent people from covering their ears while you scream about conspiracy
theories over corn subsidies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FLOSS levels the “free speech” playing field because the code - speech - can
be modified and redistributed freely with no special benefits or harms for the
originating developer nor for the forking developer. In this context, the
cries of “violating free speech” are laughably lazy; an unhappy user can fork
it and have their speech - code - compete fairly. It isn’t censorship of the
user, because once more the user - who has developer-like capabilities in the
FLOSS world - can fork and compete on a level playing field.</p>

  <p>- @cj@mastodon.technology, <a href="https://cjslep.com/c/blog/on-tusky-rickrolling">cjslep.com</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This point is relevant because of issues that much of the fediverse community
had with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_(social_network)">Gab</a> creating
their own Mastodon instance and beginning to federate with other servers. I
won’t go over all of the controversy, but the gist is that many Mastodon
instances and other developers refused to federate with Gab because of their
political association, sparking massive backlash from Gab’s community
complaining that Mastodon was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deplatforming">“Deplatforming”</a> them and
“infringing on their right to free speech”. Most of these arguments were based
on the idea that the Mastodon project
<a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/07/statement-on-gabs-fork-of-mastodon/">shouldn’t be allowed to assert their political standing</a>,
and that social networks are some kind of public-domain service that everyone
deserves an equal share in. To people that think this, I respond: your right to
free speech is not a right to free audience. You decide what comes out of your
mouth, and I decide whether or not I have to listen to it. Being banned from one
social network doesn’t duct tape your mouth shut, won’t prevent you from using
the internet, and certainly isn’t a human rights violation. But I digress…</p>

<h3 id="broken-federation-is-okay">Broken Federation is Okay</h3>

<p>One of the reasons that some people argue against federated social networks is
that this federation can be broken by instance-level blocks like those which
have been implemented for Gab. An issue that John Henry
<a href="https://hackernoon.com/mastodon-is-dead-in-the-water-888c10e8abb1">points out</a>
is that the federated model implicitly couples moderation with a user’s
identity. If another network is deemed inappropriate by your federated instance,
then no interactions with users on that network will be visible to you unless
you specifically follow them. However, as Robert Sharp explains, this problem
doesn’t have to be as big as it seems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the case of Mastodon, the limits of the federation model might be a
strength. A semi-permeable social network, which restricts access to certain
instances, might be perfect for children and schools, for example. And of
course there will be iterations to the software that improve on the current
solution and perhaps give more control to individual users.</p>

  <p>- Robert Sharp, <a href="https://www.robertsharp.co.uk/2017/04/06/free-speech-identity-and-mastodon/">robertsharp.co.uk</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, if you join a social network, you’re subject to the views and judgement of
its owner - but that’s nothing new. Twitter, YouTube, and almost all social
websites in existence all have their own terms of use and moderation teams that
review what you say. Nobody should be in charge of moderating their own posts,
and treating all people differently in a federated model would create far too
much work for the network’s moderators. A fully distributed social network is
unrealistic, and centralized networks give too much trust to a single party -
I restate: federation is a compromise, not an ideal.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>

<h3 id="join-the-fediverse">Join the Fediverse!</h3>

<p>I didn’t realize it when I started writing this, but a lot of the points that I
wanted to cover in this post already exist over at
<a href="https://runyourown.social/">runyourown.social</a> - so if this has gotten you
interested in joining or creating a federated social network, I highly recommend
checking that site out. <a href="https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/">fediverse.party</a>
also contains a summary of a bunch more useful resources and information about
these projects.</p>

<h3 id="dont-mess-it-up">Don’t mess it up.</h3>

<p>I believe I’ve hinted at this point a few times throughout this post, but I’ll
say it again here:
<em>decentralization is not a universal solution to all your problems on the web.</em>
There might be some nice aspects that it provides, but just as the freedom to do
as you want can be a feature, a lack of governance and regulation can be a
problem too. The fediverse is a nice halfway mark between a centralized and
distributed service that gives you the freedom of federation with the
practicality of a centralized site, but there are obvious problems with giving
everyone free self-hosted software for them to do whatever they want with (Gab
being a prime example of this, in its use to facilitate misinformation and hate
speech). Of course, decentralization has its good sides - creating tools to
overcome actual censorship by an oppressive government, for example - but it is
important to acknowledge that it has negative aspects as well. Luckily, most
developers in the fediverse seem to understand this, and put a lot of care into
creating systems that can empower their users to regulate these behaviors as
much as they facilitate them.</p>

<h3 id="twitter--bluesky">Twitter / Bluesky</h3>

<p>Yes, the timing of this post coincides fairly significantly with Twitter’s
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012553/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-developers-reaction-mastodon-activitypub">announcement</a>
that they will be creating a “decentralized standard for social media”. I’m
going to be clear: I don’t like this one bit. Something that Darius Kazemi
mentioned in their talk was that their greatest moral victory would be “the day
that Twitter and Facebook have to have ActivityPub interoperability for their
networks in order to harvest value from this other network that’s outside of
them”, and this is <em>kind of</em> heading in that direction, but it’s almost like
Twitter is posing a sort of ultimatum to the federated social community. They’ve
flipped the tables, so instead of Twitter being forced into adopting an existing
community-managed standard, they want to <em>design their own</em> and force the rest
of the community to adopt that instead. The assumption made by most of the
community about why Twitter is doing this is because they’ve seen some sort of
value in it that they’re missing out on (<em>cough cough advertising industry</em>),
and they don’t want the creation of these tools and services to fall out of
their grasp.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] This is not an announcement of reinventing the wheel. This is announcing
the building of a protocol that Twitter gets to control, like Google controls
Android.</p>

  <p>- <a href="https://twitter.com/MastodonProject/status/1204791506143457281">@MastodonProject@twitter.com</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there’s no guarantee that Twitter <em>will</em> go ahead with this, given
the pretty heavy backlash that they’ve received from the community. However, in
the event that they do, I would warn against adopting this in place of the
<em>truly independent</em> standards like ActivityPub because this poses significant
danger to the future of federated social media and who gets to govern it.
Ideally, the answer would be noone.</p>
