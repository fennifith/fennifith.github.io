These are my dotfiles. You may look, but please do not touch. They bite.

More seriously, despite not being licensed, feel free to steal anything from this repository; I didn't write the programs these are for.

The files in this repository are split across branches; one branch for each laptop. The "master" branch is used for general files (such as this one) and changes that should occur on all of my machines

Things:

- I use i3
- Text editor is either nano or [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro)
- I keep track of all the things I forget, and then [scream](https://github.com/fennifith/dotfiles/blob/master/../../../AAH) when I can't remember them
