<p>This page lists all (I hope) of the open source projects that are used to create, update, and maintain my personal site.</p>

<h2 id="jekyll"><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></h2>

<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server.</p>
