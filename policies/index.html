			James Fenn built the ${name} service as a ${price} and ${oss} ${type}. This service is 
			provided by James Fenn at no cost and is intended for use as is.
			<br><br>
			This page is used to inform ${type} users of my policies regarding the collection, use, 
			and disclosure of any personal information that this ${type} collects during the use of 
			my service.
			<br><br>
			If you choose to use my service, then you agree to the collection and use of information
			in relation to this policy. The personal information that I collect is used to provide
			and improve the service. I will not use or share your information with any party except
			as described in this privacy policy.
			<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
			For a better experience during the use of my service, I may ask that you provide me with
			certain personally identifiable information described below. The information that I request
			is ${use}.
			<ul>
				${data::<li>I may request your ${info} in order to ${inorderto}.</li>::}
			</ul>
			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique 
			identifiers. These are sent to your browser from websites that you visit and are stored on your 
			device's internal memory.
			<br><br>
			This service ${cookies:usage}. These "cookies" are ${cookies:use}. You have the option to either
			accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose
			to refuse these cookies, you will not be invited to my annual bake sale.
			<h3>Security</h3>
			I value your trust in providing me with yor personal information, and as such I am striving to use
			commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, please be aware that no method of transmission
			over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and I cannot guarantee its absolute
			security.
			<br><br>
			Additionally, in the event that someone in my near vicinity visits the webpage located at
			<a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ</a> with their speakers at their 
			interpretation of "full blast", I may abandon any security maintenance activities that I happen to
			be in the process of performing in order to substitute that with my interpretation of "appreciating my jam".
			<h3>Links to Other Services</h3>
			This service may contain links to other websites and applications not developed by me. If you open a 
			third-party link, you will be directed to that service. Note that these services are not operated by
			me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these services. I have no control
			over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites
			or services.
			<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
			This privacy policy does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally 
			identifiable information from children under 13. In the case that I discover that a child under 13 has 
			provided me with personal information, any relevant information will be immediately removed from my
			servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal
			information, please contact me so that I am able to perform the necessary actions.
			<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
			I may update this privacy policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically
			for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page. These changes
			are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
			<h3>Contact Me</h3>
			If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please do not hesitate to contact me at 
			<a href="mailto:policies@jfenn.me">policies@jfenn.me</a>.
